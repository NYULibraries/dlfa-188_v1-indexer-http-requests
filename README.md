# dlfa-188_v1-indexer-http-requests

See [DLFA-188: v1 indexer: set up a GitHub repo containing all Solr HTTP requests for a full indexing job](https://jira.nyu.edu/browse/DLFA-188)

Note that the HTTP requests for the most run were not generated directly from the EAD files repo, [findingaids\_eads\_v2](https://github.com/nyudlts/findingaids_eads_v2).  They were instead generated from the EAD files in [findingaids\_eads\_test\_fabified](https://github.com/NYULibraries/findingaids_eads_test_fabified), which were themselves generated by the [FASB](https://github.com/nyudlts/dlts-finding-aids-fasb) `fabify` command with [findingaids\_eads\_v2](https://github.com/nyudlts/findingaids_eads_v2) files as input.
